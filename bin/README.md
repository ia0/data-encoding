To install the binary from the [github] repository:

```
cargo install --path=bin
```

To install the latest version published on `crates.io` (does not require to clone the repository):

```
cargo install data-encoding-bin
```

By default, the binary will be installed as `~/.cargo/bin/data-encoding`.
Assuming `~/.cargo/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable, you can see the
usage by running:

```
data-encoding --help
```
