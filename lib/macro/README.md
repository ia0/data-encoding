This library provides macros to define compile-time byte slices and arrays from
encoded strings (using common bases like base64, base32, or hexadecimal, and
also custom bases). It also provides a macro to define compile-time custom
encodings to be used with the [data-encoding] crate.

See the [documentation] for more details.
