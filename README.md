This repository provides the following Rust crates for data-encoding:
- The `data-encoding` library provides common and custom encodings, like
  hexadecimal, base32, and base64. See the [documentation] for more information.
- The `data-encoding-macro` library provides compile-time facilities. See the
  [documentation][macro] for more information.
- The `data-encoding-bin` binary is a command-line tool to define and use
  encodings. See the [binary] for more information.
- The [website] provides a playground to define and use encodings.
